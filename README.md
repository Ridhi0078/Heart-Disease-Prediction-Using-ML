# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project uses Logistic regression to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient based on medical attributes. It's built using python and Jupyter Notebook, with Heart disease UCI dataset from Kaggle.

## Project Overview

**Goal:** Predict whether a patient has heart disease(Binary Classification)
**Logistic Regression:** Logistic Regression
**Dataset:** UCI Heart Disease Dataset

## Dataset Features

The dataset includes following features:
- `age`: Age of the patient
- `sex`: 1 = male; 0 = female
- `cp`: Chest pain type (4 values)
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure
- `chol`: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
- `restecg`: Resting ECG results
- `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved
- `exang`: Exercise induced angina
- `oldpeak`: ST depression
- `slope`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- `ca`: Number of major vessels (0-3)
- `thal`: Thalassemia
- `target`: 0 = No heart disease, 1 = Heart disease

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results

- **Accuracy:** 81.96%
- It performs well for binary classification on medical datasets with limited features.
